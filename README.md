This is a collection of selected hypersonic exercises made for my exam finals.
In particular:

- Relaxation layer downstream a Normal shockwave
- Atmospheric re-entry
- Taylor Maccoll solver implementation and some other script regarding conical flow
- boundary layer of a flat plate using viscous interaction method
- approximate theories implementation for a 2D airfoil
