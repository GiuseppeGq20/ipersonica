# Conical Flow

## Taylor Maccoll equation

let us consider the flowfiled of a supersonic cone. If we assume that:
- the flow is non viscous, nor reacting
- the flowfiled is completely supersonic
- the cone shock wave is attached
- the cone has zero angle of attack $\alpha$
We can simplify the euler equations, by expressing them in spherical refernce frame
originating from the cone. In fact, in this settings, for the symmetry of the problem
the shock wave is conical and concetric to the cone, so that the flow is homoentropic
and thus the flow field does't depend on the azimutal angle and the velocity in that
direction is null. Furthermore, the thermofluid dynamic properties of the flow 
don't dependo on the radial coordinate.
So we obtain the Taylor Maccoll equations: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dv_r}{d\omega}&= v_w\\
\frac{dv_\omega}{d\omega}&=\frac 1 {C - 2v_\omegaÂ²}[2v_w v_r \frac{dv_r}{d\omega} -C(2v_r + v_\omega\cot(\omega))]\\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $v_r$ and $v_\omega$ are the velocity components divided by $V_{lim} = \sqrt{2H}$ and
$C= \frac {\gamma-1} 2 (1 - v_r^2 - v_\omega^2)$.  
This set of equation can be numerically solved but the peculiar aspect of it are
the boundary conditions: to integrate this system we must know the velocity components
$v_r (\omega)$ and $v_\omega (\omega)$, after the shock but tha shock
angle is unknow. This lead to a iterative procedure to find 
the appropriate shock angle for a given cone.

### Numerical procedure

To solve the Taylor Maccoll equation the following numerical procedure can be 
adopted:

1) Integrate the Taylor Maccol equations with an appropriate ODE solver, starting
from a given shock angle $\beta$, and stop the integration when $v_w=0$, the $\omega$
angle at which $v_w=0$ is the cone angle $\delta_c$ that realizes that shock angle$\beta$ 

2) Then we can use a root-finding algorithm on the error function: 
   $$
   e(\beta)= \omega_{fin}(\beta)-\delta_c
   $$
   The $\beta$ obtained is the shock angle for the specified cone, whith $\delta_c$.

>**note**: the implementation in the code is with a secant method , varying the initialization
of the algorithm we can get the strong or the weak solution for the shock angle,
however this method does not guarantee the convergence to the solution for any possible
initialization


## maximum cone angle $\delta_c$ at fixed $Ma_\infty$

The maximum cone angle $\delta_c$ is the angle that realize a Mach number equal to
one downstream the shock.  
We can adopt the following strategy to find it:

1) Let us define the error function $f(Ma_\infty , \beta) = M_2 -1$
2) find the angle $\beta$ such that $f=0$ 
3) Solve the Taylor-Maccoll equation with $\beta$ calculated at the preceeding step, 
from the solution we get $\delta_{c,max}$

## aerodynamic coefficients

We can calculate the $\c_p$ distribution of a pitched cone by using local cone
method and the High method. Because of the genesis of these methods, the $c_p$ 
distribution depend only on the $\phi$ coordinate, with this observation we can
express the aerodynamic force divided by the freestream dynamic pressure:
$$
\frac F {q_\infty}= \int_0^R \int_0^{2\pi}  c_p(\phi) \frac r {sin(\delta_c)}drd\phi = \frac {R^2} {2 sin(\delta_c)} \int_0^{2\pi} c_p(\phi) d\phi
$$
It is worth noting that these method only give decent results for small angle of 
attack

### $C_{Fx}$ and ${C_{Fy}}$ calculation

The $x$ axis coincide with the cone axis and so the force for unit dynamic pressure 
$F_x$ is given by eq. (2).  
To get the force for unit dynamic pressure along the $y$ axis we must project
the radial aerodynamic force onto the $y$ axis thus, obtaining eq. (3).
The reference area is the lateral surface of the cone
$$
C_{F_x}= \frac {F_{x}}{ \frac {\pi R^2}{\sin(\delta_c)}} = 
\frac {\sin(\delta_c)}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} c_pd\phi \tag {2}
$$

$$
C_{F_y}= \frac {F_{y}}{ \frac {\pi R^2}{\sin(\delta_c)}} = 
\frac {\cos(\delta_c)}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} c_p\cos(\phi)d\phi
\tag{3}
$$

These two finite integrals can be numerically evalueted once the $c_p$ distribution
is known.

### $C_l$ e $C_d$ calculation

$C_l$ e $C_d$  can be evaluated with the following realtions:
te trasformazione 
di rotazione di un angolo  pari all'angolo di attacco $\alpha$ :
$$
\begin{aligned}
C_d&= C_{F_x}\cos(\alpha) + C_{F_y}\sin(\alpha) \\
C_l&= -C_{F_x}\sin(\alpha) + C_{F_y}\cos(\alpha)\\
\end{aligned}
$$
